# Statistical-Modeling-for-Data-Science-Applications

# Specialization - 3 course series
Statistical modeling lies at the heart of data science. Well crafted statistical models allow data scientists to draw conclusions about the world from the limited information present in their data. In this three credit sequence, learners will add some intermediate and advanced statistical modeling techniques to their data science toolkit. In particular, learners will become proficient in the theory and application of linear regression analysis; ANOVA and experimental design; and generalized linear and additive models. Emphasis will be placed on analyzing real data using the R programming language.

# Applied Learning Project

Learners will master the application and implementation of statistical models through auto-graded and peer reviewed Jupyter Notebook assignments. In these assignments, learners will use real-world data and advanced statistical modeling techniques to answer important scientific and business questions.
